## Notes

### :notebook: 9/2/2021

- Python exception handling follows the Easier to Ask for Permission (EAFP) philosophy, rather than the Look Before You Leap (LBYL) philosophy.
  - EAFP implies that you try to get something to work, and catch exceptions (with `try`/`except` blocks) if the attempt fails.
  - LBYL implies that you write conditional checks to prevent exceptions from happening in the first place.

- Pick an existing application to work with for the Day 26-27 exercises.
