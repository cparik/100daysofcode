### :notebook: 9/3/21

- Selected DND game from day 13 as a program to test with error handling.
- Define a list of potential errors the game could return:

    1. `ModuleNotFoundError`, for failed import.
    2. `ValueError`, for invalid user input.
    3. `KeyboardInterrupt`, for a keyboard interrupt sequence (ctrl + c)
