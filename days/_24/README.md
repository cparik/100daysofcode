## Notes:

#### :notebook: 8/19/20

- Ideas for a useful decorator:
    - Convert a text string into URL-encoded format.
    - Convert a text string into a code-safe format.
        - I.e. Convert "Demo Server #1" to "demo-server-1".
    - Convert a `tuple` to a `namedtuple`.

- Created `pytest` tests in [test_name_that_tuple.py](test_name_that_tuple.py) to test for a decorated function that converts an iterable into a `namedtuple`.
- Created a decorated function in [name_that_tuple.py](name_that_tuple.py) that converts an iterable into a `namedtuple`.
