## Notes

### :notebook: 5/9/22

- Watched videos 1-4.
- Verified the existence of an existing Google app-specific password intended for use with Python.
- The required Python modules are `smtplib` and `mime`, and are part of the Python Standard Library.
- Created two blank Python files to support sending emails:
    - [./blob/main/days/_64/emailer_app/emailer.py](./blob/main/days/_64/emailer_app/emailer.py).
    - [./blob/main/days/_64/emailer_app/emailer_mime.py](./blob/main/days/_64/emailer_app/emailer_mime.py).

### :notebook: 5/10/22

- Watched video 5.
- Added basic functional code to - [./blob/main/days/_64/emailer_app/emailer.py](./blob/main/days/_64/emailer_app/emailer.py).
    - Refactored code with a `send_email` function, and added `print` statements at each steps for a better interactive experience.
