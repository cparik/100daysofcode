## Notes

### :notebook: 6/19/22

- Decided to build a basic Flask application that includes a form.

- Created a simple, static Flask application with two files:
    - Main application: [_76/flask_app/app.py](https://github.com/timothyhull/100daysofcode/blob/main/days/_76/flask_app/app.py)
    - Default template: [_78/flask_app/templates/index.html](https://github.com/timothyhull/100daysofcode/blob/main/days/_78/flask_app/templates/index.html).

- Created a simple Flask form input application that displays user form input for their first name.
