#### :notebook: 6/20/21

- Watched video 4.
- Created [`program.py`](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/days/13/program.py) and [`actors.py`](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/days/13/actors.py) files to test `class` development and `class` inheritance.
- Inserted the same code in the working [Jupyter Notebook](object_classes.ipynb).
- Working to determine the relationship between inherited and a `super` `class`.
