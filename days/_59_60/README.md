## Notes

### :notebook: 1/16/22

- Reviewed project options, and selected the option to [build a web app with Bottle, SQLAlchemy, and the Twitter API](https://realpython.com/building-a-simple-web-app-with-bottle-sqlalchemy-twitter-api/).
    - I will build the application using a TDD methodology, [mocking API calls to Twitter](https://pybit.es/articles/twitter-api-geodata-mocking/) with `@patch.object`.
    - I will develop the application in a separate, public repository so I can use [Better Code Hub](https://www.bettercodehub.com) to perform code analysis.
    - I will look to use other techniques I've learned in the 100DaysOfCode course, including:

        1. Decorators
        2. Classes
        3. Pytest Fixtures
        4. Logging
