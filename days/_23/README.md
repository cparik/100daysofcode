## Notes:

#### :notebook: 8/16/21

- Started PyBite 22.
    - Unable to complete the challenge using the materials covered in the video lessons although one of the articles mentioned in the lesson has a reference to an article on [Advanced Uses of Python Decorators](https://www.codementor.io/@sheena/advanced-use-python-decorators-class-function-du107nxsv).
        - I am unable to pass an argument into a decorator successfully.
    - A skim of the article indicates I need to create a function that returns a decorator in order to successfully complete the task.
    - I thought I could complete this challenge in one day although this may be a good opportunity to implement some `pytest` tests, given more time.
